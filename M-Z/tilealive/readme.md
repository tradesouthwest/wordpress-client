== Project Descrip/Scope ==
1) I need to hide my add-on products conditional logics that appear on the cart page form, except for the final conditional add-on product with total price.
2) I need to switch the placement of the add-on products listed in the cart. I want them to be below the booking date and time, not above.
3) I also need the add-on products title to be on the left of the page, and the price on the right of the page.
4) The "remove product" button is overlapping the product below. I would like it to be aligned beside the product not below.

## Description and Tips

File uses BS3 so u may update or replace
There are a few prewritten items inside some of the alphanumeric chapters. These are only there to help you understand how the process of indexing entries is done.
The menu will send you to a chapter/section starting with the letter or number you choose but, you will want the entries to stand out so they can be foud quickly.
UI has been found easiest for offsetting title to the right, just far enough so it its easy to see.
You can also bold/strong tag the titles but I found the offset works just fine.
